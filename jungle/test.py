'''
THE master test script.
1.Runs through utils test cases to confirm the system is working
2.Navigates all of the content dir prototypes and classes test cases
Notes: to avoid redoing the same potentially time consuming test cases even if the code hasn't changed, there should be a log that keeps track of succesful and failed testcases and skips over test files that havnt been modief since their last succesful test. Either ensure that each file is self contained in its class dependencies or check for modification in the files dependencies.
